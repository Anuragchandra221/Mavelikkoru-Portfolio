                <p class="about">
                    I was the great-great-grandson of a Brahmin sage named Kashyapa, the great-grandson 
                    of a demonic dictator, Hiranyakashipu, and the grandson of Vishnu devotee Prahlada. This links
                     the festival to the Puranic story of Prahlada of Holika fame in Hinduism, who was the son of 
                     Hiranyakashipu. Prahlada, despite being born to a demonic Asura father who hated Vishnu, rebelled
                      against his father's persecution of people and worshipped Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu tries to kill his
                       son Prahlada, but is slain by Vishnu in his Narasimha avatar, Prahlada is saved.

                    Prahlada's grandson, ie Me, came to power by defeating the gods (Devas) and taking over
                     the three worlds. The defeated Devas approached Vishnu for help 
                     in their battle with me. Vishnu refused to join the gods in violence against me 
                     because I was a good ruler and his own devotee. Me, after his victory over the gods,
                      declared that I would perform a Yajna (homa sacrifices/rituals) and grant anyone any request during
                       the Yajna. Vishnu took the avatar his fifth of a dwarf monk called Vamana and approached me.
                        I offered anything to the boy gold, cows, elephants, villages, food, whatever he wished.
                         The boy said that one must not seek more than one needs, and all he needed was "three paces of land." I agreed.

                <p class="about">
                    Vamana grew to an enormous size and covered everything I ruled
                     over in just two paces. For the third pace, I offered my head 
                     for Vishnu to step on, an act that Vishnu accepted as evidence of my
                     devotion. Vishnu granted me a boon, by which I could visit again, 
                     once every year, the lands and people that I previously ruled. This revisit marks the 
                     festival of Onam, as a reminder of the virtuous rule and my humility in keeping my
                      promise before Vishnu. The last day of my stay is remembered with a nine-course
                       vegetarian Onasadya feast.
